                <blockquote>I enjoy getting out in the woods. I've mentioned to some people that when I get
                out in the woods I stop measuring time with normal standards, I prefer to measure in "soup
                    cycles" (the amount of time it takes to cook soup over an open fire). One of my
                    favorite yearly camping trips is called the Frozen Butt Hang on the North Shore in
                    January. I've had fun riding my bicycle over mountains and around the country full loaded with
                    camping gear.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>Over the last two years I've started sewing. I wanted to learn to make my our
                    camping gear. Eventually I started making wool anoraks that are great for winter
                    activites. I made one for myself and then those around me liked them enough I now make
                    them for others as well. Some times they get used to traverse mountains.</blockquote>

                <blockquote>After 10 years of cooking professionally I've come to appreciate the complexity
                of cooking. Everything you do has so many moving parts. Learning to balance flavors and
                    textures has been a passion of mine. Pork especially has been and intriguing medium to
                    play around with, I've learned to respect an animal and use it to the best of my abilities.
